# ocp4-power-workload-tools
This repository aids the debug of scheduling on ppc64le.

The [`ocp4-power-workload-tools` project](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-power-workload-tools) provides code to debug workloads on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x compute workers on a variety of platforms.

## Use

To deploy `quay.io/powercloud/ocp4-power-workload-tools:main` use: 

```
❯ oc apply -k manifests/overlays/multi
...
project.project.openshift.io/openshift-power-workload created
daemonset.apps/ocp4-numa-power-workload created
```

### Use fio debug

```
kustomize build manifests/overlays/fio | oc apply -f -
oc rsh pod/<pod-name>
...
cat << EOF > /tmp/perf.fio
[global]
name=perf-seq-read
time_based
ramp_time=5
runtime=30
readwrite=write
bs=256k
ioengine=libaio
direct=1
numjobs=1
iodepth=32
group_reporting=1

[vd]
filename=/dev/vda
EOF

fio /tmp/perf.fio 
```

## Design

This code is designed to be modular. The code base favors Dockerfile, Ansible, however does accept code in shell and hcl.
